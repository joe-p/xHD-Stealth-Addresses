# xHD Stealth Addresses

This repo contains an early prototype of stealth addresses via Algorand's xHD key derivation scheme. Stealth addresses allow a sender to send funds to a receiver without publicly linking the transaction to the receiver's public address.

## Disclaimer

This is an early prototype and should not be used in production. The code has not been audited and may contain vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk.

## Design Changes

Everything in this repo is subject to change and will likely undergo breaking changes throughout a future ARC submission process.
